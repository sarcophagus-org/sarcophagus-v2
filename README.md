# Sarcophagus V2 Specifications

This repository exists to serve two purposes:

1. As the discussion hub for the new "version 2" rewrite of Sarcophagus.

Head on over to [Discussions](https://github.com/sarcophagus-org/sarcophagus-v2/discussions) to grok, participate, and help decide the direction of Sarcophagus ðŸ§ 

2. As the official specifications documentation for Sarcophagus.

The [System Requirements Specification](./system-requirements-specification.md) is a living document, currently existing as a Markdown document, who's goal is to be the official reference for anyone to grok what Sarcophagus is.

Specifications diagrams and flowcharts are being created using the markdown-like [`mermaid`](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/) syntax.
