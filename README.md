# Sarcophagus V2

This repository exists to serve as the discussion hub for the new "version 2" rewrite of Sarcophagus!

Head on over to [Discussions](https://github.com/sarcophagus-org/sarcophagus-v2/discussions) to grok, participate, and help decide the direction of Sarcophagus ðŸ§ 

We expect that as ideas become more fleshed out and concrete, those discussions, and the actionable issues that come from them, will spin out into their own discussions and issues in more specific repositories.
