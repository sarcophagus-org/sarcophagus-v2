# Sarcophagus V2 Specifications

This repository exists to serve two purposes:

1. As the discussion hub for the new "version 2" rewrite of Sarcophagus.

Head on over to [Discussions](https://github.com/sarcophagus-org/sarcophagus-v2/discussions) to grok, participate, and help decide the direction of Sarcophagus ðŸ§ 

2. As the official specifications documentation for Sarcophagus.

We expect that as ideas become more fleshed out and concrete, these discussions and specifications, and the actionable issues that come from them, will spin out into their own discussions and issues in more specific repositories.

Specifications are currently being created as various diagrams and flowcharts, using the markdown-like [`mermaid`](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/) syntax.
